- 👋 Hi, I’m @javi-aranda, crafting software from Málaga, Spain.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Data Engineering and Information Security topics.
- 👨‍💻 At the moment I'm developing mostly in Python, below there is a chart of my most used languages across public repos.
- 🆕 Other technologies I'm exploring currently:
  - Apache Airflow to manage data pipelines.
  - Machine Learning models to improve phishing and/or malware detection.
  - Profiling and monitoring tools.
